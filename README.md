# Fakepoll
This Node.js application was designed after a few frustrating finance projects. Professors always want you to conduct online/physical surveys when doing market analyses etc. Everything to do with these surveys are annoying. It's a school project, and nobody has time to fill out surveys.

If you have a set of survey questions with a certain desired response, check out Fakepoll! Choose between 50 and 2500 "fake" responses, enter your inputs, and the program will skew the results accordingly.

I plan on implementing a charting framework (Chart.js or something) to better visualize the data at the end, but for now, just take the info to a site like https://imgflip.com/chart-maker. 

Cheers!
